Learn To Program Kubernetes Using Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Kubernetes for a couple of years now. I&amp;rsquo;d like to start going beyond the traditional infra/sysadmin/platform engineer knowledge of k8s. My goal is to learn how to program k8s using Go Lang. I need to learn things like client-go, kube builder, operator-sdk, and create kubectl plugins.</description></item><item><title>2019 Project Report Card</title><link>https://www.spmalloy.com/posts/2019-projects-report-card/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spmalloy.com/posts/2019-projects-report-card/</guid><description>Here is how I did on my 2019 projects. This was the first year I attempted this. The most important thing I learned is that I need to sign myself up for less projects in 2020 because I tend to spread myself too thin.

Learn Go Lang.</description></item><item><title>2019 Projects</title><link>https://www.spmalloy.com/posts/2019-projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2019 21:31:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.spmalloy.com/posts/2019-projects/</guid><description>Inspired by Scott Lowe I am posting my list of projects/goals for 2019.

Learn Kubernetes. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Kubernetes for about a year now. But I still have not really sat down and done any serious deep dive studying on this technology yet. My goal is to really dig into Kubernetes this year.
Learn Go Lang. I have an ops/infrastructure back ground.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Hugo</title><link>https://www.spmalloy.com/posts/welcome-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 23:48:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.spmalloy.com/posts/welcome-to-hugo/</guid><description>Switch from Jekyll to Hugo.
