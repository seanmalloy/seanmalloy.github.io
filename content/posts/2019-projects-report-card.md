Here is how I did on my [2019 projects](https://www.spmalloy.com/posts/2019-projects). This was the first year I attempted this. The most important thing I learned is that I need to sign myself up for less projects in 2020 because I tend to spread myself too thin.

1. **Learn Kubernetes**. I give myself an A. This is what I send most of my day doing. So it was pretty easy for me.

2. **Learn Go Lang**. I give myself a B. I was able to create several Go applications at work this year. I also read the first 7 chapters of [The Go Programming Langurage](https://www.gopl.io).

3. **Learn to use an IDE**. I give myself a C. I'm using VSCode on my work and personal laptops. I did not really spend much time learnig any of the fancy shortcuts or more advanced features.

4. **Learn basic Spring Boot**. I give myself an F. I did not get around to doing this. I didn't even start.

5. **Get my blog/website started**. I give myself a D. I wanted to do 6 blog posts in 2019. I only did one.

6. **Contribute to Open Source**. I give myself an A. I was able to contribute to the [k8s descheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler). I'm also now one of the maintainers for the [eumonia k8s operator](https://github.com/KohlsTechnology/eunomia) and [git2consul](https://github.com/KohlsTechnology/eunomia).
