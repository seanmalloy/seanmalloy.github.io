Inspired by [Scott Lowe](https://blog.scottlowe.org) I am posting my list of projects/goals
for 2020. These are the skills I'd like to improve on this year.

1. **Learn To Program Kubernetes Using Go**. I've been working with Kubernetes for a couple of years now. I'd like to start
going beyond the traditional infra/sysadmin/platform engineer knowledge of k8s. My goal is to learn how to program k8s using
Go Lang. I need to learn things like [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go), [kube builder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/),
[operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk), and create [kubectl plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-cli-plugin).

2. **Learn eBPF**. I'd like to improve my production troubleshooting and debugging skills. eBPF or just BPF is a new Linux kernel feature
that allows very deep dive production troubleshooting.

3. **Start Learning AI/ML**. This one is pretty far outside my comfort zone. I'd like to use Python to start learning the fundamentals of
AI and ML. This one is going to be a challenge for me.

4. **Start Playing Cello Again**. Its been roughly 11 years since I've played cello. I think it is time to start playing again.
