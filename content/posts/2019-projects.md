Inspired by [Scott Lowe](https://blog.scottlowe.org) I am posting my list of projects/goals
for 2019. These are the technology skills I'd like to improve on this year.

1. **Learn Kubernetes**. I've been working with Kubernetes for about a year now. But I still
have not really sat down and done any serious deep dive studying on this technology yet. My goal
is to really dig into Kubernetes this year.

2. **Learn Go Lang**. I have an ops/infrastructure back ground. I would say for an infrastructure guy
I have some fairly descent coding skills, but I feel like it is time to take my coding skills to the
next level in 2019. I've primarily coded in dynamic languages in the past(Perl, Python, Ruby, Shell),
so I feel like tackling a statically typed language will be a good challenge for me.

3. **Learn to use an IDE**. This feels like kind of a silly goal in 2019. I've primarily used VIM as
my text editor, and have never seriously used an IDE before. I've settled on learning Visual Studio Code.

4. **Learn basic Spring Boot**. Many of the applications that run on the infrastructure I support are
written using [Sprint Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). I'm not much of a Java programmer,
so this on will be interesting.

5. **Get my blog/website started**. Pretty self explanatory. I'd like to at least create 6 blog posts
in 2019.

6. **Contribute to Open Source**. I was fairy successful at this in 2018, but would like to push myself
harder in 2019. I haven't decided exactly which projects I want to contribute to. My initial thoughts are
Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Hashicorp related projects.
